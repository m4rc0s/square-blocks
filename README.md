# Square Blocks Grid System
First steps with an simple and clean CSS Grid Framework written in SASS that is based on one of most popular web elements positioning pattern known as **Grid System**. But in **Square Block** you will not think about grids directly, the Square describes de Wrapper thats something similar to an matrix with rows and cols where **row class** are **horizontal** and **vert** are the **vertical seprator** and do the same of **col**.

# It's the same Grid System
It **does exactly the same of others Grid Systems** do, but with different names and thinking in **Squares** instead **Grids**.

# Notes
It's simple and clean version developed to use in an specific project, and to study Sass.
The future is to improve this.

# Contribute
